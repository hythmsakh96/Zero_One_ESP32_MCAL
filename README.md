# Zero_One ESP32 MCAL Libraries

This repository contains **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) libraries** for the ESP32 platform, along with example projects to demonstrate their usage.

The goal is to provide **clean, reusable, and educational embedded code** that showcases low-level control of ESP32 peripherals, useful for learning, teaching, and professional embedded software development.

## ðŸ“Œ Features (in progress)
- **GPIO** â€“ control digital pins for LED, button, etc.
- **ADC** â€“ read analog sensor values
- **PWM** â€“ generate signals for motors, LED dimming
- **UART** (planned)
- **I2C & SPI** (planned)
- **Timers, WDT, CAN, Ethernet** (future)
